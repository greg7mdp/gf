# luigi

A barebones GUI library for Win32 and X11. 

The debugger frontend [gf](https://github.com/greg7mdp/gf) is built with `luigi`.

See the [example](https://github.com/greg7mdp/gf/blob/main/examples/luigi_example.cpp)

`luigi` consists of two files, `luigi.hpp` and `luigi.cpp`. To integrate directly into your application, you can #include `luigi.cpp` in one file, in `luigi.hpp` in any other file that needs to make gui calls.
